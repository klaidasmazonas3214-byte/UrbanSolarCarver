UrbanSolarCarver Sky Patch Weighting Module

Generates sky-patch direction vectors, solid angles, and per-patch weight
distributions for the voxel carving pipeline.

Core Functions
--------------
1. fetch_tregenza_patch_directions(device) → torch.Tensor
   Lazily loads a Ladybug ViewSphere and returns a (P×3) tensor of unit
   vectors for the P Tregenza sky patches.

2. fetch_tregenza_patch_solid_angles(device) → torch.Tensor
   Returns a length-P tensor of solid angles (steradians) per patch.

3. compute_EPW_based_weights(mode, epw_file, hoys, device, ...) → torch.Tensor
   Climate-based weights via Ladybug SkyMatrix (Perez all-weather model).
   Supports modes: irradiance, benefit, daylight.

4. compute_radiative_cooling_weights(dew_point, bliss_k, device) → torch.Tensor
   Theoretical radiative cooling potential per patch (Martin-Berdahl +
   Bliss angular attenuation).  Assumes horizontal analysis surface.
Compute_weights yields all the sky-patch coefficients necessary to
accumulate per-voxel exposure scores. Tregenza vectors and solid angles
are also available for diagnostics or custom weighting schemes.

    Scientific background
    ---------------------
    • Sky (hemispherical) emissivity, εₛky  
      The clear-sky emissivity in the 8-13 µm thermal-IR window can be
      estimated from near-surface water-vapour content.  Martin & Berdahl
      (1984) fit a quadratic in relative dew-point x = T_dp / 100 °C
      to a wide range of radiometer measurements:

          εₛky(x) = 0.758 + 0.521 x + 0.625 x²                (Eq. 1)

      A larger εₛky means the sky behaves more like a blackbody,
      emitting and absorbing more long-wave radiation and therefore
      offering less potential cooling for a hot surface.

    • Directional emissivity (ε_dir)
      Long-wave exchange also depends on zenith angle θ: the drier,
      higher-altitude air seen near the zenith is usually "blacker" than
      the humid boundary layer near the horizon.  Bliss (1961) proposed
      an exponential attenuation law that relates the hemispherical
      value in Eq. 1 to a direction-dependent value:

          ε_dir(θ) = 1 - (1 - εₛky)^(1 /(k · cos θ))          (Eq. 2)

      with k ≈ 1.8 for clear nocturnal skies.  The code clamps
      cos θ to `1e-3` to avoid division by zero at the horizon.

    • Radiative cooling potential  
      A surface "sees" the sky patch through its solid angle Ω_p.
      Assuming the surface itself is nearly black in the long-wave,
      its net radiative heat *loss* in direction *p* is proportional to

          (1 - ε_dir) · Ω_p                                 (Eq. 3)

      because (1 - ε_dir) is the fraction of the surface's own emission
      not returned by the sky (i.e. the deficit in sky emission).


    Parameters
    ----------
    dewpoint_celsius : float
        Outdoor dew-point temperature [°C].  Acts as a proxy for
        absolute humidity in Eq. 1.
    bliss_k : float, default=1.8
        Empirical constant from Bliss (1961) governing angular variation of atmospheric
        emissivity. Typical clear-sky values range 1.5 - 2.0; larger k increases zenith-horizon contrast.
    device : torch.device
        Target compute device for the returned tensor.

    Returns
    -------
    torch.Tensor  (length = P sky patches, dtype =float32)
        cooling weights wᵢ ≥ 0,  Σ wᵢ = 1.

    Notes
    -----
    * **Assumes horizontal analysis surface** (flat roof).  The view-factor
      weighting cos(θ)/π used in Eq. 3 is only correct for an upward-facing
      horizontal surface.  For tilted or vertical surfaces the angular
      integration bounds change significantly; applying these weights to
      non-horizontal surfaces will over-weight the zenith and under-weight
      low-altitude patches.
    * Valid for clear nights; clouds would raise εₛky toward unity and
      flatten the weight distribution.
    * Units cancel, so the weights are dimensionless fractions that can
      multiply any radiative-heat-transfer coefficient in further
      calculations.

    Scientific background
    ---------------------
    * Sky patch geometry — Tregenza subdivides the hemisphere into
      145 quasi-equal solid-angle patches.
      `fetch_tregenza_patch_` returns Ωᵢ and view vector
      d̂ᵢ = (lᵢ, mᵢ, nᵢ)** with nᵢ = cos θ*.

    * time-based — Baseline uninformative prior:  
      wᵢ = 1/P. 
      For time-based carving using traditional time-based solar envelope methods.

    * daylight — The CIE Standard Overcast Sky (Darula & Kittler 2002)
      prescribes relative luminance  
      L(θ) ∝ (1 + 2 cos θ)/3.  

    * irradiance — 'SkyMatrix.from_epw' (Ladybug Tools) builds a
      Perez All-Weather sky for every time step, then integrates the
      selected hours ('hoys') to obtain cumulative short-wave
      energy per patch:

          wᵢ = Σₜ (E_dirᵢₜ + E_difᵢₜ) [J m⁻²]

      where E_dirᵢₜ is direct beam contribution and E_difᵢₜ
      diffuse.

    * benefit — Uses Ladybug's heating-benefit framework
      implemented in 'SkyMatrix.from_components_benefit', whereby only
      solar gains occurring when Tₐ < T_bal - ΔT are credited:

          wᵢ = Σₜ (E_dirᵢₜ + E_difᵢₜ) · H( T_bal - ΔT - Tₐₜ )

      with Heaviside switch H. 'balance_temperature'
      (T_bal) and 'balance_offset' (ΔT) loosely represent the
      building's heating set-point and internal gains.
      A Grasshopper/Ladybug simple E+ workflow is included. It
      can be used to derive project-specific balance temperatures.
      
    Parameters
    ----------
    mode : {'time-based', 'daylight', 'irradiance', 'benefit'}
        Weighting strategy (see table above).
    epw_path : str
        Path to an EPW file.  Required for *irradiance* and *benefit*.
    hoys : Sequence[float]
        Hour-of-year indices to sample.
    device : torch.device, default 'cuda' if available else 'cpu'
        Compute device for the returned tensor.
    ground_reflectance : float, default 0.2
        Lambertian ground albedo used by Perez model.
    balance_temperature : float, default 15 °C
        Base-temperature for the heating-benefit filter.
    balance_offset : float, default 2 °C
        Dead-band between comfort set-point and base temperature.

    Returns
    -------
    torch.Tensor
        Shape (P,), dtype float32, residing on device.
        Weights are non-negative.  Only ``radiative_cooling`` normalises
        to Σwᵢ = 1.  Other modes preserve the physical scale returned
        by Ladybug (Wh/m² for irradiance/benefit) or the CIE luminance
        distribution (daylight).  Threshold methods (carve_fraction,
        headtail) are scale-invariant, so the difference does not affect
        carving results.

    Notes
    -----
    * The EPW-driven modes assume typical meteorology; rare events
      (e.g. > 99th percentile irradiance) may be under-represented.
    * For benefit mode the heating-balance filter is purely
      temperature-based; construction, occupancy and HVAC control logic are not
      considered.
