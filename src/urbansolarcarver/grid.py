UrbanSolarCarver — Grid utilities

Tools for sampling nearly planar geometry, converting meshes to voxels,
cleaning occupancy, and building meshes. Used by the carving pipeline
to generate point/normal sets, binary grids, and final surfaces.

Overview
--------
Two meshing modes are supported:

1) Cubic (apply_smoothing == False)
   - Clean the binary grid with component pruning, a 3×3×3 majority filter,
     and one 6-connected closing.
   - Triangulate with a cubic voxel mesher (Kaolin dual-cubes).

2) Smoothed SDF (apply_smoothing == True)
   - Convert occupancy to a signed distance field (SDF) in voxel units.
   - Light Gaussian blur, then edge-preserving Perona–Malik diffusion
     applied only near the zero level.
   - Pick an iso value that preserves the original inside volume.
   - Extract a surface with marching cubes (trimesh + scikit-image).
   - Optionally run a tiny Taubin polish (0..6 iters) after cleanup.

Public API
----------
sample_planar_surface(mesh, sample_step, include_boundary=True)
    Uniformly sample a strictly planar patch and return per-point normals.

discretize_surface_with_normals(mesh, sample_step, coplanarity_tol_deg=5.0)
    Collect point/normal pairs and an analysis mesh from near-planar components.

voxelize_mesh(mesh, voxel_size, margin_frac, device=None)
    Rasterize a watertight mesh into a padded cubic occupancy grid.

prune_voxels(voxels, min_voxels)
    Remove 26-connected components smaller than min_voxels.

prune_voxels_morph(voxels, min_voxels)
    Gentle cleanup for the cubic path: component prune, majority filter,
    single closing. Preserves thin slabs better than erosion/opening.

voxelize_and_clean(mesh, voxel_size, margin_frac, min_voxels)
    Convenience wrapper: voxelize_mesh then prune_voxels.

mesh_from_voxels(voxels, min_corner, voxel_size)
    Build a blocky mesh from the binary grid. Returns an unprocessed Trimesh.

mesh_from_voxels_smoothed(voxels, min_corner, voxel_size)
    Build a smooth mesh by contouring a smoothed SDF with marching cubes.
    Uses a volume-matched iso to avoid systematic thinning.

mesh_from_voxels_select(voxels, min_corner, voxel_size, apply_smoothing)
    Dispatch to the cubic or SDF path based on the flag above.

cleanup_mesh(mesh, min_face_count=100)
    Fix winding/normals, weld vertices, drop tiny fragments.

polish_mesh_taubin(mesh, iters=0)
    Optional micro-polish after SDF+MC. Scale-normalized. Safe for 0..6 iters.

Internal helpers
----------------
plane_frame(normal)
    Orthonormal in-plane basis for planar sampling.

_voxel_presmooth(field_bool)
    SDF build + Gaussian + narrow-band Perona–Malik diffusion.

_pm_anisotropic_diffuse(sdf, iters, k, tau)
    Edge-preserving diffusion stepper used by _voxel_presmooth.

_volume_matched_threshold(sdf, target_inside_voxels)
    Iso selection that matches the original inside count.

_median_edge_length(mesh)
    Median of unique edge lengths; used to normalize the Taubin polish.

Data types and units
--------------------
- Points and normals: np.ndarray, shape (N, 3), world units.
- Voxel grids: torch.Tensor, shape (D, D, D), uint8/bool, 1 = inside.
- Meshes: trimesh.Trimesh in world coordinates.
- voxel_size is in world units and is passed to marching cubes as pitch.

Notes
-----
- The cubic path aims for stable, interpretable “voxel look” with minimal
  flicker between runs. No erosion by default to protect thin volumes.
- The smoothed path operates in SDF space, not on the triangle mesh. This
  removes terracing while keeping the overall form.
- The Taubin step is deliberately tiny and optional. Heavy smoothing belongs
  in SDF space, not post-mesh.
