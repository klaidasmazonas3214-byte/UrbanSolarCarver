    """First stage of the 3-stage envelope pipeline: per-voxel obstruction scoring.

    Converts a maximum-volume mesh and a set of insolation test surfaces into
    a 3-D scalar field where each voxel carries a score indicating how much it
    obstructs the surrounding context.  The pipeline steps are:

    1. Voxelization -- the maximum-volume envelope mesh is discretised into
       a regular Boolean grid at the resolution specified by ``cfg.voxel_size``.
    2. Surface sampling -- insolation test surfaces are point-sampled
       (density controlled by ``cfg.grid_step``), yielding test points
       with associated outward normals.  The test surface PLY file may
       contain multiple disjoint mesh components (e.g. separate facade
       panels, a ground plane and a courtyard, or a PV array).  All
       components are sampled and their ray contributions aggregated into
       a single score grid.
    3. Ray casting -- for every test point, rays are cast through the voxel
       grid according to the configured mode.  Each voxel that blocks a ray
       accumulates a weight that depends on the mode:

       * ``time-based``: sun-position rays for the configured analysis period;
         scores are integer *violation counts* (number of sun-hours blocked).
       * ``tilted_plane``: geometric plane-intersection test; scores are also
         violation counts.
       * sky-patch modes (``irradiance``, ``benefit``, ``daylight``,
         ``radiative_cooling``): rays are
         sampled from a discretised sky hemisphere weighted by radiance or
         irradiance; scores are *weighted sums* reflecting the total sky
         contribution obstructed by the voxel.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cfg : user_config | str | Path
        A validated ``user_config`` instance, or a filesystem path to a YAML /
        JSON configuration file that will be loaded and validated.
    out_dir : str | Path
        Root output directory.  All stage artifacts are written directly
        into this directory (no subdirectory is created).

    Returns
    -------
    PreprocessingResult
        Frozen dataclass with paths and metadata for the completed stage.

    Persisted artifacts
    -------------------
    ``scores.npy``
        3-D ``float32`` array (same shape as the voxel grid) with raw
        obstruction scores.
    ``voxel_grid.npy``
        Boolean occupancy grid so downstream stages can skip re-voxelization.
    ``manifest.json``
        Machine-readable manifest (``PreprocessingManifest``) recording grid
        origin, extent, voxel size, score semantics, and file paths.
    ``diagnostics/``
        Per-stage diagnostics: score histogram, sky-patch weight visualisation
