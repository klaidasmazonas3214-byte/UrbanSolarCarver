"""USC Mode — Select carving mode.

Provides a validated mode string for the USC pipeline. Each mode
determines how sky-patch weights are computed:

  - time-based:        Uniform weight per patch; carving preserves
                       sun access during user-defined HOYs. (needs EPW)
  - irradiance:        Cumulative solar irradiance (Wh/m²) from EPW
                       direct + diffuse. (needs EPW)
  - benefit:           Net heating benefit — irradiance weighted by
                       balance-point temperature. (needs EPW + Benefit Params)
  - daylight:          CIE overcast sky luminance — geometry only,
                       no weather data needed.
  - radiative_cooling: Long-wave cooling potential to the sky vault
                       (W/m²). (needs EPW)
  - tilted_plane:      Geometric daylight-envelope sweep — not a
                       weighted evaluation. (needs Tilted Plane params)
