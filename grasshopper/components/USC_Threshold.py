"""USC Threshold — Control how the score volume is binarized.

The threshold determines which voxels are "obstructing" (removed) vs
"kept" (part of the final envelope).

Inputs
------
method : str, optional
    Threshold strategy. One of:
      "carve_fraction" — remove voxels accounting for X% of total score
      "headtail"       — head-tail breaks (for skewed distributions)
      "numeric"        — direct raw-score cutoff
    If None, uses the mode default (carve_fraction).
value : float, optional
    Meaning depends on method:
      carve_fraction → fraction of total obstruction to remove (0-1).
      headtail       → ignored (algorithm is automatic).
      numeric        → raw score threshold; voxels above are removed.
score_smoothing : float, optional
    Gaussian blur radius (meters) applied to the score volume before
    thresholding.  Smooths resolution-dependent noise so the carved
    mesh is cleaner at fine voxel sizes.
    None (default) = auto: 1.1 × voxel_size.
    0 = disabled.
    Positive value = explicit radius in meters (1.0–1.2× voxel_size
    recommended; over-smoothing above 2× rounds features).
    Only affects weighted-score modes (irradiance, benefit, daylight,
    radiative_cooling).
carve_above : bool, optional
    If True, carve all occupied voxels above the lowest
    sufficiently-carved region in each (x, y) column.  Removes
    structurally implausible floating mass above carved zones.
    Default: False.
carve_above_min : int, optional
    Minimum consecutive carved voxels in a column before carve_above
    activates for that column.  Higher values (2-3) prevent stray
    single-voxel carvings from triggering aggressive removal.
    Default: 1.

Outputs
-------
overrides : str
    Semicolon-joined key=value string for Config.
